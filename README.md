### Stack
- Stack :- A linear data structure following LIFO (Last In First Out). Example: plates stacked in a pile.
- Stack using ArrayDeque :- Efficient stack implementation using Javaâ€™s ArrayDeque.
- Stack Implementation using Array :- Basic stack operations (push, pop, peek) using arrays.
- Reversing a String using Stack :- Uses stackâ€™s LIFO property to reverse a string.
- Check Balanced Parentheses :- Validates expressions by checking matching brackets using stack.

### Sorting Algorithms
- Selection Sort :- Repeatedly selects the smallest element and places it at the correct position.
- Insertion Sort :- Builds the sorted list one element at a time by placing each in its correct position.
- Merge Sort :- A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that splits the array and merges sorted halves.
- Bubble Sort :- Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- Quick Sort :- A divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions the array around a pivot and sorts recursively.

### Trees
- Binary Search Tree (BST) :- A binary tree where the left child is smaller and the right child is larger than the root. Supports fast searching, insertion, and deletion.
- AVL Tree :- A self-balancing BST where the height difference of subtrees is at most 1, ensuring O(log n) operations.
- Segment Tree :- A tree data structure used for range queries (like sum or min) and updates in O(log n).

### Graphs & Algorithms
- Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (Shortest Path) :- Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
